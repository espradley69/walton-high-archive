# walton-high-archive
a bunch of videos, pictures and files to make sure old/any of these files are going to stay here permanently 

Hi my name is Logan I am a student at walton and these files are taken from deep inside computers in walton's labs I am the only person working on this but that isnt to say there wont be more for the 4 years im here (yes im a freshmen) I will be updating this unless I lose intrest lol but I will try my best to not let my adhd get to me, I will also put all the info i can find on the file I archive. There are really old and intresting stuff in these archives so stay tuned for more.:)

(I used winrar to compile some of the files https://www.win-rar.com/ or just download it here https://www.udrop.com/75MN/winrar-x64-611.exe)
