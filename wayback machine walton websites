1998
http://web.archive.org/web/19981203025403/http://www.waltonhigh.org/ this is the earliest captures there are 525 captures total
most of the links work but some dont especially if there not on the main page it has info about george walton here http://web.archive.org/web/19981205020524/http://www.waltonhigh.org/whsinfo/gwalton.htm
the scho first opened its doors in 1975 that means there is a lot to archive and it will be hard to get the really old stuff but i will try my best overal the website is really basic
thats probably because it was build when the internet was very new 

2008
http://web.archive.org/web/20080412134653/http://www.cobbk12.org/~Walton/ it seems they changed there website domain in the early 2000's in 2008 they are changing to a completly 
new wedsite the new website http://web.archive.org/web/20080517113235/http://www.waltonhigh.org/ contains a option to sign up to the news and very basic bot protection
and its here we find are first picture under the e news link http://web.archive.org/web/20140303213641im_/http://www.waltonhigh.org/photos/myrandom/588/smallWalton%20Pic.jpg
it seems that a few of the links were not work at the time this website existed and it was not done just like ctls when it was created lol if you click on a link that didnt work
at the time of the website you will get this http://web.archive.org/web/20131209083306/http://waltonhigh.org/documents.cfm this is not wayback machines fault 
overall this website was not built very well

2011 
http://web.archive.org/web/20110901223330/http://www.waltonhigh.org/index.cfm walton was officaly reconized as one of the best school in georgia number 67 out of 79 i belive i could be wrong
there are upgrades to the website and overall looks a bit better 

band

not much to say other than the band website is very new and the one that looks older looksbad

chorus
http://web.archive.org/web/20041103060644/http://www.waltonchorus.com:80/ unlike walton band waltons chorus goes back to 2004 where it looked bad
it was mostly used to thank volunteers and sponsors not much to say other wise

2017
http://web.archive.org/web/20170723044312/https://www.waltonhigh.org/
